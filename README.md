# Give Me Some Credit Dataset Analysis and Credit Scoring Model

This repository contains a project focused on analyzing the "Give Me Some Credit" dataset using Python in Google Colab. The primary goal of this project is to gain insights into borrowers' credit behavior and repayment tendencies while developing a credit scoring model using machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview

In this project, we performed an in-depth analysis of the "Give Me Some Credit" dataset, which includes information about borrowers and their credit histories. Using Python and various libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn, we conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, and feature engineering to prepare the dataset for modeling. The project also involves the creation and evaluation of a classifier model using the decision tree algorithm.

## Project Environment

The entire project, including code, analyses, and visualizations, was developed in Google Colab, providing an interactive and collaborative platform for coding and data exploration.

## Project Highlights

- **Data Exploration and Preprocessing:** We started by exploring the dataset, checking for missing values, and visualizing key features' distributions. Missing values were imputed using K-nearest neighbors imputation, and duplicates were removed to ensure data quality.

- **Feature Engineering:** We introduced additional informative columns, such as AgeGroup, DebtToIncomeRatio, and CreditUtilizationRatio, which provided further insights into borrowers' characteristics and credit behavior.

- **Model Development:** A decision tree classifier was trained using the processed data. We split the dataset into training and testing sets, scaled the features, and used the decision tree algorithm to build the classifier. Model performance was evaluated using accuracy.

- **Extra Analysis:** Additional analyses were performed to investigate correlations between features, delinquency rates by age group, debt-to-income ratios, survival analysis, and cluster analysis. These analyses enriched our understanding of the data and potential trends.

## Conclusion

Through thorough dataset analysis and feature engineering, we gained valuable insights into borrowers' credit behaviors and characteristics. The decision tree classifier provided an initial approach to predicting credit risk. Additional analyses, such as survival analysis and cluster analysis, expanded our understanding of the dataset's nuances.
